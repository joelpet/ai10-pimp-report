Sokoban is a puzzle created in 1981 by Hiroyuki Imabayashi. Sokoban is a
difficult puzzle and it has been proven that it is
PSPACE-complete~\cite{culberson1997}, which is a superset of NP. Current
solvers use techniques such as iterative deepening search (IDS), depth-first
search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), A* and combination of them to
traverse the search tree. Sokoban has a large branching factor which result in
a large search tree. To be able to traverse the search tree in any reasonable
time, pruning techniques and heuristics are necessary. Humans can solve
Sokoban puzzles by advanced heuristics that becomes natural to us after playing
the game for a while.


\section{Problem statement}

% a clear formalization of the problem using course material: which methods, how and why

Our task is to implement a program that is able to solve as many Sokoban levels
as possible. We have received test data that contains 136 levels to test our
solver against. However, we are not supposed to specialize our solver(s) for
this set of levels.


\part*{Theory and method}

% Explain the solutions we tried, answer why, how and what?
% A summary of your design approach and implementation

Sokoban can be solved by many different methods, as it is NP-hard and
PSPACE-complete it has not been proven that there exists an optimal solution,
but there are ways to prune the search tree and different kinds of heuristics
that can be used to find a solution faster. Our focus has been on pruning
techniques to reduce the size of the search tree, with heuristics for choosing
the search depth and solver. Our work resulted in three different solvers ---
IDSPusher, IDSPuller and a Bidirectional search combining them both.


\section{Solvers}

We chose to use iterative deepening search, also called IDS, when
implementing the solvers. The reason we chose IDS over breadth-first search,
BFS,  was simple, memory consumption. A normal BFS would need to store every
state it intends to visit in a queue, which would require large memory
footprint. Our original assumption was that depth-first search, DFS, would go
down too deep into the tree and possibly go past solutions, which was the
reason we originally chose IDS. IDS is simply a DFS that only goes down to a
certain level in the tree, if we find the solution we are done, otherwise we
increase the depth and try again.

When we began to implement the bidirectional search we found that IDS was
perfect, as we could simply let the agents take turn going deeper.

\subsection{IDSPusher}

To push the boxes around is the most natural solution, as it is how the game
actually works. The basic idea was a brute-force approach that mimicked the
human way to solve Sokoban puzzles. The naïve implementation of a pusher is
simple and easy to understand, however it is not particularly effective.
Because of this we implemented a couple of pruning techniques, like tunnel
detection and deadlock detection, which will be described later.

\subsection{IDSPuller}

Puller is our name for a method in which we reverse the goal and box positions.
Instead of trying to push boxes from their start positions to their goal we try
to pull boxes from the goals to their start positions. The advantage of this
approach is that no so called freeze deadlocks can occur~\cite{takes2007},
which reduces the number of useless state. This works because freeze deadlocks
occur when a box gets blocked by other boxes, and this can't happen when
pulling boxes because the player must be able to reach the square where the box
is to be pulled to.  It's still possible however to move a box such that some
boxes can no longer be reached.


\subsection{Bidirectional search using IDSPusher and IDSPuller}

Bidirectional search is a powerful way to reduce the search tree a lot
search~\cite{russell2009}. Instead of letting one solver go all the way we let
two solvers take turn to solve the board from both ends. As the size of the
search tree is exponential there is a lot to gain from this approach. Let's
look at an example.

% TODO: xun, ser detta ok ut?
In a complete binary tree, there is $2^n$ nodes on the level at depth $n$. Thus,
the total number of nodes is $2^n + 2^{(n-1)} + \ldots + 2^0$. Thinking of this
as a binary number we see that $2^n > 2^{(n-1)} + \ldots + 2^0$, e.g. $1000_2 =
8_{10} > 0111_2 = 7_{10}$. This implies that more than half of our nodes are on
the lowest level. When we use bidirectional search we only need to search to
half the depth --- two times. This means the number of nodes in the lowest level
will be $2^(n/2)$ for each one of the two solvers, which is much less than the
$2^n$ nodes required originally.

In a Sokoban problem the branch factor will typically be much higher than two
because there are often at least a couple of boxes that can be pushed from four
sides in the worst case (if there are no walls or other boxes at the sides).
That makes the bidirectional solver even more efficient for this kind of
search, even though pruning techniques may reduce the average branch factor.



\section{Pruning techniques}

\subsection{Repeated states}

One of the probably most important pruning strategy is to check for repeated
states. We might arrive at a state following different paths in the search tree,
and exploring a node is only necessary to do once. That is, if we reach a state
that we recognize, it is time to stop following that road. In order not to be
required to store the whole board in a transposition table for repeated states
checking, we have chosen to use a hashing algorithm called Zobrist keys. In
addition to reducing memory usage, this type of hashing also allows constant
time comparison of boards.


\subsubsection{Zobrist keys}

Zobrist keys is a hash function that seems to work quite well for games that has
perfect information\footnote{Every participant in the game knows all the moves}.
Sokoban is obviously such a game, which was the reason for us trying it out. The
hashing algorithm makes heavy use of the XOR operation and its property that
given two bitstrings $x$ and $y$, the result of $(x \oplus y) \oplus y$ equals
$x$.

We implemented it by generating a random number for every possible state ---
\emph{empty} or \emph{box} --- of every cell on the board, which are stored in a
three-dimensional array. In order to calculate the hash of a board, one must
start with an empty hash key and iterate over every cell on the board and
XOR in the corresponding random number for that cell and state . ``Now wait'',
you say, ``this requires $n^2$ operations''. And yes, that is true, however, the
next time we make changes to boxes on the board, we simply XOR out the box that
is being moved from its previous position and XOR it in to the new position.
That way, we have created a new hash key for an arbitrary box movement by
performing only two XOR operations, which only requires 2 operations.

% TODO Simple example with 5x3 board.

``But hey'', you object, ``you have to take the player position in
consideration too''. And yes, that is also true. The naive solution would
simply be to let a cell have a state where the player is present, in addition
to the states \emph{empty} and \emph{box}. However, that would cause many
equivalent states to generate different hashes, like those in
Figure~\ref{fig:equalStatesDifferentHash}. For that reason, we instead keep
track of the top leftmost position that the player may reach without moving any
boxes and XOR:ing the hash with that position (which is actually also hashed).

    \label{fig:equalStatesDifferentHash}
\end{figure}

%Figure 1. Example of equivalent states when player is hashed into Zobrist keys (note that x marks the top leftmost reachable player position).

The beauty of Zobrist keys is that it, as mentioned above, only requires
constant time for each box move in the board, and also is reversible in some
sense. This turned out later to be very useful, when implementing the
bi-directional search solver.

\subsection{Deadlock}

Detecting deadlock is another important pruning technique. A deadlock is a
state where it is no longer possible to solve the puzzle. For example a deadlock
is achieved when a box move result in two or more boxes being stuck. Other boxes
can continue moving on the board until the search space is exhausted. When this
happens the solver need to backtrack to a previous state where the deadlock did
not occur. By finding this deadlock a large amount of nodes in the search tree
can be pruned.

\subsubsection{Dead squares deadlock}

A \emph{dead square} is a position from which a box can never be pushed into a
goal. These can be calculated statically for every board, as the only thing
required is the positions of the walls and these do not change during the game.
The most obvious case is a corner, from which a box can only be reached from two
directions but is blocked by a walls at the opposite sides. This is used as a
starting point in our dead square detection algorithm.

We extended the dead square detection further by starting from the previously
marked dead squares and checking if the squares to the right and below can only
be moved into this square or another dead square. In that case we mark the
squares to the right and below as dead squares. This algorithm is iterative and
continues until no more changes can be made.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics{figures/deadSquareDeadlock}
    \end{center}
    \caption{An example of a dead square deadlock marking. The dead squares are
    marked with a minus sign (-).}
    \label{fig:deadSquareDeadlock}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Freeze deadlock}

Another type of deadlock is a \emph{freeze deadlock}. This occur when a box gets
blocked by a wall, dead square or another box. Because we care for other boxes
this check must be recursive with a max recursion depth of the amount of boxes
in the map. The most simple freeze deadlock is illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:freezeDeadlock}, where the two boxes is locked into their
current position by each other and the wall above.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics{figures/freezeDeadlock}
    \end{center}
    \caption{An example of a freeze deadlock.}
    \label{fig:freezeDeadlock}
\end{figure}


\subsection{No influence pushes --- tunnels}

A \emph{no influence push} is a push of a box that does not influence the board
but eventually have to happen. If such pushes can be found and grouped together
we can remove all those individual moves from the search tree and decrease the
size of it.

Tunnels is a type of no influence pushes and it is the only such strategy that
we have tried to implement. If a box is pushed inside a tunnel it makes no
difference to the boxes outside the tunnel how far the tunnel box is pushed
inside the tunnel. When we push a box inside a tunnel a new state is generated,
from this state we generate all successor states, that is we try to move all
the boxes on the board. The reason this is bad is because there is only one
thing we can do with the box inside the tunnel, so each push on another box is
done in vain, as we need to push on the box inside the tunnel sooner or  later.

In order to solve this problem we simply look at cells in a $2 \times 3$ square
around the box to see if it is a rotated or mirrored version of the states
illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:tunnelPossibilities}. Each time we detect such a
state we can simply move the box one more step and begin again with checking if
this new box position is inside a tunnel as well.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics{figures/tunnelPossibilities1}
        \includegraphics{figures/tunnelPossibilities2}
    \end{center}
    \caption{List of possible tunnel states. Must be mirrored and rotated to be
    comprehensive.}
    \label{fig:tunnelPossibilities}
\end{figure}


Figure~\ref{fig:insideTunnel} gives an example of what should be done inside a
tunnel. In the first state we need to expand all possible movements regarding
all boxes on the field. However in the second state illustrated we can be sure
that the correct movement is forward, as we just came from the only other
possible state when moving that particular box. This means that when we arrive
at a state that resembles the second state in Figure~\ref{fig:insideTunnel}, we
can directly push the box forward until we reach the third state.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics{figures/insideTunnel1}

    \end{center}
    \caption{Sequence of tunnel states.}
    \label{fig:insideTunnel}
\end{figure}

\section{Heuristics}

\subsection{Lower bound}

Before we start searching we use a greedy algorithm to calculate the minimum
distance in squares between the boxes and the goals, and use this value as the
search depth limit in the initial iteration of our IDS. This reduces the number
of iterations that have to be performed as we can be certain no solution will be
found above this depth. This is true in the bidirectional solver as well. As the
bidirectional solver consist of two separate solvers each of them only need to
go half the distance in order to meet in the middle, which is the reason we
choose to halve the lower bound for each solver in the bidirectional search.

\subsection{Adaptive deepening}

Similarly to the lower bound we use a heuristic to choose the search depth limit
for subsequent iterations. This is based on the number of leaf nodes, where we
look at the ratio between the current and the last iteration. In case of a
higher ratio, where the number of leaf nodes is constant or decreasing we make a
larger step. Again, this reduces the number of iterations needed to solve the
board.

\subsection{Choosing solver}

In our bidirectional solver we need to choose which direction to search from in
each iteration (from the start state and forward or from the goal state and
backward). We choose the solver with the minimum number of leaf nodes, because
we expect that solver to go deeper down the tree faster, as it probably has
fewer nodes to expand.

\part*{Results}

% Our result, how many did we solve? List run times, important and interesting data
% A thorough analysis of your experimental results

We successfully solved 111 of 136 of the problems listed in 60 seconds with our
bidirectional solver. Of these, 45 were solved in less than a second. The
remaining 25 problems could not be solved because the solver expanded to many
nodes in our search tree. The bidirectional solver was able to solve many more
boards than IDSPusher (71 boards) and IDSPuller (80 boards) individually (that
is, it solved almost 39 \% more than the puller). It should also be said that
the bidirectional solver not only solves more boards, but increases the speed
greatly of the boards it already solved.

When running the individual solvers (IDSPusher and IDSPuller), we saw that the
puller was able to solve a few more boards than the pusher. On the boards that
both could solve, puller was generally faster, and on a few boards it was as
much as 5 times faster. Because the two solvers were based on the same code and
had only minor differences, this suggests that the puller was indeed avoiding
more types of deadlocks.

Before we implemented the solvers using iterative depth-first search we tried
breadth-first search. We found that the algorithm required too much memory to be
practical and it was also very slow because it had to copy the board and
recreate the associated objects on each expansion of nodes. It should be noted
however that we did less pruning in these early versions of our solvers, so its
possible that a carefully optimized breadth-first search with advanced
heuristics could perform well.
